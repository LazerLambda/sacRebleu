# sacRebleu

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of sacRebleu is to provide a simple interface to the BLEU score, a metric for evaluating the quality of generated text.
This package is inspired by the NLTK and sacrebleu implementations of the BLEU score, and is implemented in C++ for the R programming language.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sacRebleu from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

### Linux and MacOS
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LazerLambda/sacRebleu")
```

### Windows
This package builds upon the [tok](https://github.com/mlverse/tok) package, which requires the Rust toolchain to be installed.
To install the rustup, follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://rustup.rs/) and at [tok](https://github.com/mlverse/tok).
After installing the Rust toolchain, you can install the development version of sacRebleu as described above.

## Example

```{r example}
library(sacRebleu)
cand_corpus <- list("This is good", "This is not good")
ref_corpus <- list(list("Perfect outcome!", "Excellent!"), list("Not sufficient.", "Horrible."))
bleu_corpus <- bleu_corpus(ref_corpus, cand_corpus)
```
