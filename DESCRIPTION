Description: Implementation of the BLEU-Score in 'C++' to evaluate the
    quality of generated text. The BLEU-Score, introduced by Papineni et al. (2002)
    <doi:10.3115/1073083.1073135>, is a metric for evaluating the quality of
    generated text. It is based on the n-gram overlap between the generated
    text and reference texts. Additionally, the package provides some smoothing
    methods as described in Chen and Cherry (2014) <doi:10.3115/v1/W14-3346>.
